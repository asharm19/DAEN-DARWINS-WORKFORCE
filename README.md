Project name: Geographically Contextual Knowledge Worker Cost 
Description: Since the COVID pandemic, many public and private organizations transitioned knowledge workers (e.g., operations research analysts) from in-office to remote/telework. Since the end of the COVID pandemic, leaders in private and public organizations have made the claim that knowledge workers doing remote/telework are less efficient than in-office employees. However, what is not known is the difference in cost by geographic location for knowledge workers who are remote/telework as compared to those who are in-office workers.
PROJECT GOALS:
    1. Develop a comparison between remote/telework and in-office knowledge workers (the team may choose the types of knowledge workers as long as it         includes one cybersecurity occupation) across the United States taking into account office space costs for private industry and the Federal             Government.
    2. Develop a map of the United States that is interactive and allows for comparisons between remote/telework and in-office knowledge workers for          private industry and the Federal Government.
